    "FAQ": {
      "question1": "Does the IOTA Foundation track my data and usage?",
      "answer1": "We can’t! This solution puts data control in your hands. We have no way of accessing the data on your phone. Whenever you share data in the demo environment, you communicate this information to our servers, but it is removed as soon as you complete the demo or close the connection. Also, only functional cookies are used on this website and during the demos. Once companies run demos or applications on their own servers, the IOTA Foundation, and other parties, will not be aware of the usage or data. Data is shared peer-to-peer making it impossible for others to listen in.",
      "question2": "Can I restore my data if I lose my phone?",
      "answer2": "Not yet. This is currently a demonstration application, which means it doesn’t have all the features that a full release would have. The application is using (mostly) fake data, therefore recovery is not our priority.",
      "question3": "Does my personal data get uploaded to the Tangle?",
      "answer3": "No. In accordance with GDPR regulaions, absolutely no personal information is uploaded to the Tangle. Not even in a (pseudo)anonymized state. Because data on the Tangle is immutable, any personal data uploaded to the Tangle would be in violation of the right to be forgotten.",
      "question4": "How does this application benefit from IOTA and DLT in general?",
      "answer4": "Organizations sign credentials for the users, but how do we identify the organizations? Their digital identities are uploaded to the Tangle and are signed using asymmetric encryption methods. In addition, revocation of credentials is put on the Tangle as evidence that the credential can no longer be used.",
      "question5": "On what IOTA network does this application run?",
      "answer5": "It runs on mainnet. Since IOTA has zero fees, it isn’t any more difficult to run a demo on the mainnet than on the devnet.",
      "question6": "How can I learn more?",
      "answer6": {
        "part1": "We have released a whitepaper called ",
        "part2": "The Case for a Unified Identity",
        "part3": "It is a relatively easy introduction to the subject and explains benefits of IOTA Identity. For a deeper dive into the documentation visit our",

        "part5": "or checkout the implementation on",
        "part6": "GitHub",
        "part7": "."
      },
      "question7": "What is a DLT or Tangle?",
      "answer7": "Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the umbrella term for technologies like Blockchains. It is a decentralized database of which many copies are hosted across the world. They agree with each other on what is true and what isn't through the consensus mechanism. With Bitcoin, this process costs a lot of electricity due to its security model. The IOTA Tangle solves this, making it faster, feeless and green. The Tangle is the underlying data structure of the IOTA network, which hosts the IOTA cryptocurrency token and is developed by the IOTA Foundation.",
      "question8": "Who developed the Selv Demos?",
      "answer8": "Selv is developed by the IOTA Foundation in collaboration with different parties. The IOTA Foundation is a non-profit foundation guiding and contributing to the development of the core protocol and facilitating the development of the ecosystem around IOTA."
